# TicTacToe5
Gomoku - Five in a row - TicTacToe 5 version
==============================

This repository contains the personal project to explore game playing mechanizm by using Android. <br />
I published this app on Google Play store. It is free!

Function
------------

Created the simple UI that user can choose the size of the board, number of players, AI level and who goes first.
AI uses my own evaluation function. I commented out Min-Max for future reference to make the AI even stronger.
AI results in choosing good moves quickly and beated everyone arond me with their all of their trials.
While user is playing, user can easily unmove the move that they made or start new game/go back to home screen.

Purpose and fixes
--------------

Some lines and methods are left commented for future reference to make my AI stronger. <br />
It may be easy to add hit button. <br />
I left some lines for debugging.  <br />

Achievement 
---------------

1. Learned how to make AI that choose optimal movement. 
2. Became confortable in Android development
3. Learned a lot about how to make a good evaluation function after many trials.
4. Learned how to debug (This project required a lot of debugging!)
5. First game project to publish! (I like board games in general so in the future I may imprement more complex games.)
